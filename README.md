Rust Genealogy
==============

This is an in progress rewrite of [java-after-eight](https://github.com/CodeFX-org/java-after-eight) in rust.

Based on commit [10b7f5f15f8223c0667b63c0391f95eef9211138](https://github.com/nipafx/java-after-eight/tree/10b7f5f15f8223c0667b63c0391f95eef9211138)

Roadmap
-------
1. **Reimplement as closely as possible**
    - Rewrite the Java code in rust, adhering to the original implementation and structure as closely as possible (at the expense of idiomatic rust).
2. **Incrementally transform the code to idiomatic rust**

Currently still 1.

Comments
--------
I used special comments throughout the code base.
* FIXME, TODO: You probably know what those mean already.
* RUSTIFICATION: Notes to myself on what to do later on when rustifying.
* WTF: Me just wondering about what the original code base was doing and maybe even a TODO of sorts.
